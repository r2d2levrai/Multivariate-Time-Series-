# Multivariate-Time-Series-
LSTM Approach for Multivariate Time Series

Recurrent short-term memory (LSTM)  neural networks have difficulty in representing temporal and non-temporal inputs simultaneously, due to the architecture's emphasis on sequential. This limits the  applicability of LSTMs in settings where multivariable data are difficult to adjust. 
In this repository, several approach is proposed in which a set of univariate LSTMs are proposed for temporal sequences.
